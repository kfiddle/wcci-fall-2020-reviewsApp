My first exploration of Spring MVC in a simulated review site. Years ago, a "Beer and Scotch" tavern I knew allowed customers to bring their own cigars, and the place was beautiful and dark, with of course an expansive menu. Here, I've included Plain-Old-Java-Objects to complete the back-end, and a little bit of sorting for the ReviewRepository to make it possible to choose reivews pages which list either all of the Scotch's, or all of the Beers. These pages connect you with a page which lists any single drink and its review. 

The images are linked from the back-end to the static folder, and the review content is linked to text files, also in the static folder. 

Each review has an instance variable called "stars", which, at the moment, is a link to one of five small screenshots of the kind of stars you'd see when looking at any online review. (I'll make a more sophisticated version of this soon when I look into JavaScript).
