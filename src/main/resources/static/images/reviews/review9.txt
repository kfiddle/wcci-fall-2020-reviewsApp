I read that there are twenty belgian beers that one should try before one dies, and since I was pleasantly surprised to see one on the menu at this place, I figured I'd see what it was about. It was ok, but honestly, had I died without trying it, I don't think I'd have regretted much. It's ok, but a little on the plain side as belgians go.
