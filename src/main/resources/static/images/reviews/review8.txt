Nice! I haven't been to this place before, and so I have a safety fall-back in times like this. If you don't know what you're getting into with a new spot, just get whatever Amber Ale they have on draft. You're probably going to be ok, and this isn't the case with most other things. (I've been to spots that take such pride in their hoppiest beers, and I usually want to feed these to my dog.) Troegs, however, generally works, and this is no exception.
