It's always a politically incorrect cliche when you read up on new scotches...everyone seems to like this, and how can such good scotch be distilled in...Japan? Trust me, it's good. Until recently, Japanese distilleries actually had peat shipped in right from Scotland to use in their distilling, although I understand that this isn't the case anymore. (Plus, this is way cheaper than Macallan, at least for now.)
