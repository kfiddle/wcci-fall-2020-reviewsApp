Ok, first of all, I'm biased. I can't seem to do the smokey scotch thing. It just feels like I'm drinking pure iodine, and so I figured I'd try again with Ardbeg, and to no avail. Plus, since they allow cigars on the patio, I brought one and promptly ruined it with this scotch. I'd stay away unless the Islay stuff is your type.
